# High Quality Screen-Space Ambient Occlusion for OpenMW

## Features

- Normal-aware: Unlike most SSAO shader mods, this shader takes the surface normal into account and so interacts properly with normal
  maps and other sub-polygon surface lighting techniques.

- Many parameters to configure: Find your personal sweet-spoot between quality and performance while achieving the
  look and feel you're after.

- Downsampling & blurring support: Reduce the performance hit with minimal impact on visual quality.

- Behaves correctly with complex scenes: No more 'occlusion halo' artifacts.
